# Challenge Summary
This function takes a list and inserts a new value into the middle of the list. 

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Approach included length calculation, midpoint calculation, repeated evaluation of the new value in relation to the midpoint, and returning an index. 

Big O time is O(N).
Big O space is O(1).
